Clone the [datausa-site repo](https://github.com/DataUSA/datausa-site)  

Run the following within your local datausa-site folder.  

Setup the environment:

	python3 -m venv .env

Run one of these:

OSX / Linux:

	source .env/bin/activate

Windows:

	\.env\Scripts\activate.bat

Tried installing [datausa-api](https://github.com/DataUSA/datausa-api)  

If you install Python using brew, the relevant headers are already installed for you.
In other words, you don't need python-devel.

# County Industry Data Prep  

The following documents how to generate a CSV file containing BLS data pulled from the [EPA's Flowsa API](https://datacommons.org).  

## BLS Data Preparation 

The steps below have been applied in our [Google CoLab for exploring NAICS](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HLK4HIUMLlgTR524QoCKvfaNl-La48XU?usp=sharing) which can be used to output 6-digit naics by state to a [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EoWDvNoaKO8xLclX4fr5exw83jJkkJIy) on Google Drive. Loren manually saved [3 years](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state/GA/naics).  The original Python also resides in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa/tree/master/colabs).

[Compare to FactFnder](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US13&n=336111&tid=CBP2018.CB1800CBP&hidePreview=true)  

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) industry data  
BLS data is pulled using the [FLOWSA Python script](https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/blob/master/flowsa/BLS_QCEW.py)
maintained by Catherine Birney.

How Flowsa data is prepared - Creating a FlowByActivity Dataset

If you change BLS_QCEW.py, do so in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa).

Check for 6-digit 336111 automobile industry NAICS when outputting using FLOWSA.  
Note that only 4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" in [BLS downloadable files](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm).  


Output to [state data files](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state)    

Output 5 columns with names: fips, naics, employees, wages and firms (establishment count)

- fips - Location (fips for county)  
- naics - ActivityProducedBy (6-digit naics)  
- employees - Employment FlowAmount (Number of Employees)  
- wages - Money (Annual Wages)
- firms - Other (Number of Extablishments)
