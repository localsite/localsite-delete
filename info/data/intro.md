# Local DataUSA.io

We have not yet figured out how to hit the DataUSA API rather than local postgresql database.

Clone the [datausa-site repo](https://github.com/DataUSA/datausa-site)  

Run the following within your local datausa-site folder.  

Setup the environment:

	python3 -m venv .env

Run one of these:

OSX / Linux:

	source .env/bin/activate

Windows:

	\.env\Scripts\activate.bat

Optional, upgrade pip and postgresql

	pip install --upgrade pip
	brew upgrade postgresql

Install dependencies

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Install dependencies (generates node_modules folder)

	npm install
<!--
Avoid this:

	yarn install

Issue: package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.  
-->

Build the app - this will created the index.js file

	npm run build

Launch site

	npm start

Error:  

Database: postgresql://undefined:*********@undefined:5432/undefined  
Can't authenticate to database.  

Question: How would we hit the DataUSA API rather than a local postgresql database?  

Tried installing [datausa-api](https://github.com/DataUSA/datausa-api)  

If you install Python using brew, the relevant headers are already installed for you.
In other words, you don't need python-devel.

# County Industry Lists - Data Prep  

The following documents how to generate a CSV file containing BLS data pulled from the [EPA's Flowsa API](https://datacommons.org).  

You may also opt to pull from static json files generated for the [USEEIO widgets](../../../io/charts/).  

The following verified that holes resided in Automotive Manufacturing at the county level.  To resolve, an Google Sheet could hold [auto manufacturing employment levels](../../info/#show=vehicles) exported from state DOL data.  And/or PUMA data may allow for comparison.

## BLS Data Preparation 

The steps below have been applied in our [Google CoLab for exploring NAICS](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HLK4HIUMLlgTR524QoCKvfaNl-La48XU?usp=sharing) which can be used to output 6-digit naics by state to a [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EoWDvNoaKO8xLclX4fr5exw83jJkkJIy) on Google Drive. Loren manually saved [3 years](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state/GA/naics).  The original Python also resides in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa/tree/master/colabs).

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) industry data  
BLS data is pulled using the [FLOWSA Python script](https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/blob/master/flowsa/BLS_QCEW.py)
maintained by Catherine Birney.

If you change BLS_QCEW.py, do so in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa).

Check for 6-digit 336111 automobile industry NAICS when outputting using FLOWSA.  
Note that only 4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" in [BLS downloadable files](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm).  


Output to [state data files](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state)    

Output 5 columns with names: fips, naics, employees, wages and firms (establishment count)

- fips - Location (fips for county)  
- naics - ActivityProducedBy (6-digit naics)  
- employees - Employment FlowAmount (Number of Employees)  
- wages - Money (Annual Wages)
- firms - Other (Number of Extablishments)
