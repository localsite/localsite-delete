# Data Setup

Our summer 2021 Georgia Tech intern is pulling U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data from the EPA's Flowsa API for use in calculations of county-level 6-digit naics industry projections. The algorithms developed will be shared in the Fall 2021 edition of Applied Science.  

<!--
We're aiming to provide the EPA impact data through Google Data Commons and DataUSA.io.  

We'll start by displaying with Data Commons standardized chart syntax using YAML.

Are any maps or navigation standards using YAML for layer lists (instead of [json](ga-layers.json)?)
